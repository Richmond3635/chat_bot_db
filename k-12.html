			<h1>Implementing the SHS Program</h1>
			<img src="gallery/img6.jpg" class="img6">
			<p class="a">The K to 12 Program covers Kindergarten and 12 years of basic education (six years of primary education, four years of Junior High School, and two years of Senior High School [SHS]) to provide sufficient time for mastery of concepts and skills, develop lifelong learners, and prepare graduates for tertiary education, middle-level skills development, employment, and entrepreneurship.</p>
			
 			<br><br>


 			<p class="k-12"><br> As prescribed in the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (the Act), in June 2016 DepEd will launch <br> senior high school (SHS) nationwide, a new level of basic education consisting of grades 11 and 12. In December <br> 2014, the ADB approved the SHSSP, a $300 million results based lending (RBL) program to support the establishment and <br> implementation of SHS during 2014-2019 the government's K to 12 education reform program. The SHSSP supports four <br> results areas with loan disbursements tied to the achievement of six disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). Among the <br> results areas supported by the SHSSP are the establishment of a SHS voucher program for graduates of public junior <br> high schools (JHSs) and some private JHSs to attend private SHSs, and assessing the feasibility of using <br> infrastructure public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the delivery of some SHS infrastructure.</p>
